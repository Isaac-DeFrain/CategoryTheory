# 8.1 Function Objects, Exponentials
Universal constructions:
1. Pattern
2. Ranking
3. Best object

In the category `Set`, the hom set `Set(a, b)` of any two sets (objects) `a` and `b` is again a set.
 So we have an object in `Set` which corresponds to morphisms between any two objects.

We would also like to have this same notion in an arbitrary category.

Product is a bifunctor.

A *function object* or *exponential* `z` is s.t. given any object `z'` and morphism `g': z' x a -> b`,
 there exists a unique morphism `h: z' -> z` making the following diagram commute.
```
    z'      z' x a
    .          .\
    .          . \
    .          .  \
  h .   h x id .   \ g'
    .          .    \
    .          .     \
    v          v   g  v
    z        z x a -> b
```
i.e. `g' = g . (h x id_a)`.

This exponential is written `a => b` or `b^a`.

Correspondence between product and exponential, i.e. one-to-one correspondence between `g'` and `h` in above diagram (*currying*)
```
  C(c x a, b) ~ C(c, b^a)
```

In Haskell, currying is built in.
```
  g :: (a, b) -> c
  h :: a -> b -> c

  curry :: ((a, b) -> c) -> a -> b -> c
  curry f = \a b -> f (a, b)

  uncurry :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a, b) -> c
  uncurry f = \(a, b) -> (f a) b
```

## Correspondences between coproducts, products, and exponentials
```
  C(a + b, c) ~ C(a, c) x C(b, c)
```
```
  C(c, a x b) ~ C(c, a) x C(c, b)
```
```
  C(c, b^a) ~ C(c x a, b)
```

## Important properties of categories
  | Category | Products | Coproducts | Exponentials | Terminal object | Initial object |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Cartesian | x | _ | _ | x | _ |
  | Cartesian closed | x | _ | x | x | _ |
  | Bicartesian closed | x | x | x | x | x |

## Interpreting exponentials of types
Only one function from `Void` to a type `a`, i.e. `absurd :: Void -> a`.
```
  a^0 = 1
  Void -> a ~ ()
```

Only one function from a type `a` into `()`, i.e. the constant function.
```
  1^a = 1
  a -> () ~ ()
```

There is a function of type `() -> a` for each element of type `a`, i.e. for each `x :: a`, `f_x :: () -> a, f_x () = x`
```
  a^1 = a
  () -> a ~ a
```

A function from `Bool` to a type `a` is the same as choosing two elements of type `a`, i.e. let `x, y :: a`, `f :: Bool -> a`, `f False = x`, `f True = y`.
```
  a^2 = a x a
  Bool -> a ~ (a, a)
```
