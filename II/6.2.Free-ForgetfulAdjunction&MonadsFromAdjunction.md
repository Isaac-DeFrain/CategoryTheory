# 6.2 Free-Forgetful Adjunction, Monads from Adjunction
Monoid homomorphisms preserve the monoid structure and thus, are more restrictive than a function between the underlying sets.

To form an adjunction (i.e. isomorphism between hom sets) between the category of Monoids, `Mon` (objects = monoids, morphisms = monoid homomorphisms), and `Set`, we restrict our attention to a subcategory in `Mon` of *free* monoids.
```
         F
      <------           F x = free monoid with set of generators x
  Mon         Set       U m = underlying set of the monoid m
      ------>               Mon(F x, m) ~ Set(x, U m)
         U
```

The isomorphism `Mon(F x, m) ~ Set(x, U m)` says that the monoid homomorphisms from the free monoid (with set of generators `x`) `F x` to the free monoid `m` are in 1-1 correspondence with functions from `x` to the underlying set of `m`, `U m`. That, plus naturality in `x` and `m`.

## Monads
```
  \eta     :: Id_D -> R . L
  \epsilon :: L . R -> Id_C

  R . L = T
  \eta(a) :: a ---------> T a -- return
  \mu(a)  :: (T . T) a -> T a -- join

  R . L . R . L = T . T
  \mu = R . \epsilon . L (horizontal composition of natural transformations)
```

The monad laws follow from the triangle identities of unit and counit.

`L -| R` - adjunction: `L` is left adjoint to `R`

Every adjunction gives rise to a monad and comonad. Vice versa, every (co)monad gives rise to a (family of) adjunction(s).

### Haskell
Adjunction between product and exponentiation.
```
  L : newtype Prod s a   = Prod (a, s)
  R : newtype Reader s a = Reader (s -> a)

  instance Adjunction (Prod s) (Reader S) where
    unit   :: a -> Reader s (Prod s a) -- s -> (a, s) // state monad!
    unit a = \s -> (a, s)
    counit :: Prod s (Reader s a) -> a -- (s -> a, s)
    counit a = \s -> eval (s -> a, s)
```
