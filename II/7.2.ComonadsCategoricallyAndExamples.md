# 7.2 Comonads Categorically and Examples
"There is some kind of philosophy in a comonad" - Bartosz

Comonads are like universes that come with a special element that can be extracted from the universe.

`extend` allows us to apply local transformations to the entire universe.

## Stream
```
  data Stream a = Cons a (Stream a)
  extract (Cons a _) = a
  duplicate (Cons a as) = Cons (Cons a as) (duplicate as)
  tail (Cons _ as) = as  -- not needed for comonad, but increases functionality
```
`duplicate` returns all possible iterated streams!

Filtering streams
```
  sumN :: Num a => Int -> Stream a -> a  -- Num a means a has + operator defined
  sumN n (Cons a as) = if n == 0 then 0 else a + (sumN (n - 1) as)

  avgN :: Fractional a => Int -> Stream a -> a
  avgN n stm = (sumN n stm) / (fromIntgral n)  -- "local" - only looks at n elements after head
                                               -- cokleisli arrow after applying n

  extend (avgN n) stm  -- averaging filter for the entire signal
```

## Categorically
`W :: C -> C` endofunctor

```
  \epsilon :: W -> I      -- extract
  \delta   :: W -> W . W  -- duplicate
```

Comonad laws - unit and associativity

Recall: adjunctions
```
  \epsilon :: L . R -> I  -- counit
  \eta     :: I -> R . L  -- unit
```

```
  W = L . R
  \delta :: L . R -> L . R . L . R
  \delta = L . \eta . R
```
Comonad laws are given by the triangle identities.

A comonad is a comonoid in the category of endofunctors.

The category of endofunctors has a monoidal structure given by composition (and the identity endofunctor).

A monoid is an object `m` in a monoidal category with two special morphisms:
```
  \mu  :: m (x) m -> m  -- multiplication
  \eta :: i -> m        -- unit
```
satisfying the associativity and unit laws.

A comonoid in an object `m` is a monoidal category with two special morphisms:
```
  \delta   :: m -> m (x) m  -- comulitplication
  \epsilon :: m -> i        -- counit
```
satisfying the associativity and (co)unit laws.
