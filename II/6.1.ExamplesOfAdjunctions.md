# 6.1 Example of Adjunctions
Horizontal composition of natural transformations

The right adjoint in `Set` is always representable!

Let `D = Set` and `d = 1` (the singleton set). Then, we have
```
  C(L 1, c) ~ Set(1, R c)  (Set(1, R c) ~ R c because each function is just the selection of an element in the set R c)
  C(L 1, -) ~ R            (isomorphic as functor => R is representable!)
```

"`Hask` is like `Set` with some hand waving about infinite loops."

Universal constructions translate to adjunctions.

Example: Product
```
         \Delta               (C x C)(<c, c>, <a, b>)     <--> C(c, a x b)
        <-------
  C x C          C
        ------->
            R             (C x C)(<a x b, a x b>, <a, b>) <--> C(a x b, a x b)
```

Product is a bifunctor!

Exponentiation is the right adjoint of product!
