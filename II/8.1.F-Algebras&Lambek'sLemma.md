# 8.1 `F`-Alegbras, Lambek's Lemma
```
  type Algebra f a = f a -> a
```
Everything that we typically associate with algebra is included in this definition.

To make this point, first, let's think of a monoid `m` as an object in `Set`. `m` has two morphisms associated with it:
```
  \mu  :: m x m -> m  -- multiplication
  \eta :: 1 -> m      -- "choosing the unit"
```
Also, these morphisms will need to satisfy the monoid laws, but we'll just think about "potential" monoids.

These morphisms can be rewritten as a single morphism (by using a coproduct of the source objects):
```
  m^{m x m} x m^1 = m^{m x m + 1}
  m x m + 1 -> m
```

This thinking can be extended to other algebraic structures, e.g. a group, say an object `g \in Ob(Set)` with:
```
  \mu   :: g x g -> g
  \eta  :: 1 -> g
  \iota :: g -> g      -- inverse

  g x g + g + 1 -> g
```

In both cases, we ultimately are just dealing with an object `a` (*carrier*) in some category, an endofunctor `F`, and a morphism `F a -> a` (*evaluation*/*structure map*).

## In Haskell
Monoid as an algebra
```
  data MonF a = Munit | Mmult a a
  alg :: MonF Int -> Int  -- Int is the carrier
  alg Munit = 0
  alg (Mmult m n) = m + n
```

Ring as an algebra
```
  data RingF a = RZero | ROne | RNeg a | RAdd a a | RMul a a
  alg :: RingF Int -> Int  -- or whatever other carrier: square matrices, polynomials, etc.
```
But these are only very shallow trees... We want full-blown expression trees, like
```
  data Ring = RZero | ROne | RNeg Ring | RAdd Ring Ring | RMul Ring Ring
```
We can build up recursively (in pseudo-Haskell)
```
  data RingF1 a = RingF (RingF a)
  data RingFN a = RingF (RingF(N - 1) a)  -- for any N > 1
```

The idea is that applying an operation which has already been applied infinitely many times, one more time, doesn't change anything, i.e. if `f` is a functor and `Fix f` is an object which has had the functor applied infinitely many times to it (the *fixed point*), then
```
  Fix f = f (Fix f)
```

```
  newtype Fix f = Fix (f (Fix f))
  Fix   :: f (Fix f) -> Fix f
  unFix :: Fix f -> f (Fix f)
  unFix (Fix x) = x
  Fix . unFix = unFix . Fix = id
```

## Category of Algebras
Fix an endofunctor `F :: C -> C`. An algebra is a pair `(a, F a -> a)`.

Objects in this category are pairs of objects and morphisms: `(a, F a -> a)`

Morphisms in this category are *homomorphisms*, morphisms `m :: a -> b` which make the following diagram commute
```
       F m
  F a ----> F b
   |         |
   |         |
   v    m    v
   a ------> b
```

What does an initial object in this category look like?

Let `(i, F i -> i)` be an initial `F`-algebra and `(a, F a -> a)` any other `F`-algebra. Then there exists a unique homomorphism `m :: i -> a`.
```
       F m
  F i ----> F a
   |         |
   |         |
   v    m    v
   i ------> a
```

### Lambek's Lemma
> If `F a -> a` is an initial `F`-algebra, then `F a ~ a`.
