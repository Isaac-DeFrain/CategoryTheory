# 5.1 Yoneda Embedding

`a -> C(a, -)` is a *contravariant* functor `C -> [C, Set]` which preserves hom sets, i.e. the Yoneda lemma says `[C, Set](C(a, -), F) ~ F a` and taking `F = C(b, -)` for any `b \in Ob(C)`, we get `[C, Set](C(a, -), C(b, -)) ~ C(b, a)`.

So `a -> C(a, -)` is a *fully faithful* embedding `C -> [C, Set]`

- *faithful*: injection between hom sets
- *fully faithful*: bijection between hom sets
