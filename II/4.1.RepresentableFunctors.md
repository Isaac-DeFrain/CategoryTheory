# 4.1: Representable Functors

The `List` functor is not representable (because of the empty list).

Representable functor in Haskell:
```
  class Representable f where
    type Rep f :: *                 // means the "kind" of Rep f is a type (maybe called Key f now)
    tabulate :: (Rep f -> a) -> f a // converts a function into a container of values (data)
    index :: f a -> Rep f -> a      //
```

The `Stream` functor is representable!
```
  data Stream a = Cons a (Stream a)
```

```
  instance Representable Stream where
    type Rep Stream :: Integer
    tabulate f = Cons (f 0) (tabulate (f . (+1)))
    index (Cons a as) i = if n == 0 then a else index as (i - 1)
```
