# 7.1 Comonads
Monads <-> Kleisli arrows (embellished output values) & >=> (fish) operator
```
  return :: a -> m a // Kleisli arrow
  (>=>)  :: (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> a -> m c
```

Comonads <-> co-Kleisli arrows (embellished input values) & =>= (bird) operator
```
  extract :: w a -> a // co-Kleisli arrow
  (=>=)   :: (w a -> b) -> (w b -> c) -> w a -> c
```
where `=>=` is associative and `extract` is the identity for `=>=`.

With monads, in general, we can put values into a container, but not extract them; e.g. I/O monad.

With comonads, in general, we can extract values from a container, but not put anything inside.

## Example
Recall: Reader monad
```
  (a, e) -> b  <-> a -> (e -> b)
```

But `(a, e)` is already an embellished value and this this looks like a comonad!

Product comonad
```
  data Prod e a = P e a
```
and we need to implement `extract` and `=>=`.
```
  extract :: w a -> a // co-Kleisli arrow
  (=>=)   :: (w a -> b) -> (w b -> c) -> w a -> c

  f =>= g = \(P e a) -> let b = f (P e a)
                            c = g (P e b)
                        in c
  extract (P e a) = a
```

This is not surprising because `Product -| Reader`.

### Bird anatomy
```
  f =>= g = g . extend f

  extend :: (w a -> b) -> w a -> w b
  extend f = fmap f . duplicate

  duplicate :: w a -> w (w a)
  duplicate = extend id
```
