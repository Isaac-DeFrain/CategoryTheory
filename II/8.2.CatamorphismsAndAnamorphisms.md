# 8.2 Catamorphisms and Anamorphisms
## Catamorphisms
`Fix f` is the carrier of the initial `f`-algebra
```
  Fix   :: f (Fix f) -> Fix f  -- structure map of f-algebra with carrier Fix f, i.e. f i -> i
  unFix :: Fix f -> f (Fix f)  -- inverse of Fix, i.e. i -> f i
```

If `f a -> a` is another `f`-algebra, then there exists a unique morphism `m` which makes the following diagram commute
```
             fmap m
  f (Fix f) -------> f a
      |               |
  Fix |               | alg
      v        m      v
    Fix f ----------> a
```
Since `unFix` is the inverse of `Fix`, we also have
```
             fmap m
  f (Fix f) -------> f a
      ^               |
unFix |               | alg
      |        m      v
    Fix f ----------> a
```
which implies the following recursive definition of `m`
```
  m = alg . fmap m . unFix
```
This definition is recursive because if `m` evaluates an entire tree, then `fmap m` evaluates the children. Also, if `f a` is chosen to be a depth 0 tree, then an evaluation of these depth 0 trees (`alg`) automatically gives us a way evaluate arbitrary trees.

Since this is true for any algebra, we can write it as a higher-order function, called a *catamorphism*:
```
  cata :: Algebra f a -> Fix f -> a
  cata alg = alg . fmap (cata alg) . unFix
```

### Examples
```
  data NatF a = ZeroF | SuccF a
  fib :: Algebra NatF (Int, Int)
  fib ZeroF = (1, 1)
  fib (SuccF (m, n)) = (m, m + n)
  cata fib  -- evaluates the entire Fibonacci sequence
```

```
  data ListF e a = NilF | Cons e a
  sumAlg :: Algebra (ListF Int) Int
  sumAlg NilF = 0
  sumAlg (Cons hd acc) = hd + acc
  sum = cata sumAlg  -- sums arbitrary lists

  -- in the library, sum is defined by
  sum = foldr (\e a -> e + a) 0  -- foldr is a catamorphism for List
```

## Coalgebras and Anamorphisms
```
  type Coalgebra f a = a -> f a
```
For a terminal coalgebra `u -> f u` and any other coalgebra `a -> f a`, there exists a unique morphism `m` which makes the following diagram commute
```
            fmap m
       f u <------- f a
        ^            ^
  unFix |            | coa
        |      m     |
        u <--------- a
```

The initial algebra is the *least fixed point* and the terminal coalgebra is the *greatest fixed point*. (They are the same thing is Haskell.)

The terminal coalgebra play an analogous role to the initial algebra. Anamorphisms play an analogous role to catamorphisms.
```
  m = Fix . fmap m . coa
  ana coa = Fix . fmap (ana coa) . coa
```

### Example
```
  data StreamF e a = StreamF e a
  era :: Coalgebra (StreamF Int) [Int]
  era (p : ns) = StreamF p (filter (nodiv p) ns)
  nodiv :: Int -> Int -> Bool
  nodiv m n = n mod m != 0
  primes = ana era [2 ..]  -- lazily evaluated list of all primes
```
