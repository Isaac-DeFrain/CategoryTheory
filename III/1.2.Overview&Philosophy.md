# 1.2 Overview & Philosophy
Calculus is about infinities and infinitesimals.

A polymorphic function is a function for every type; infinite sum.

Kan extensions are like adjunctions at a higher level.

Adjunction between product and function type is *currying*.

The category of endofunctors is a monoidal category.

*Kan extension* is the adjoint of functor composition.

We need the notion of subset to do topology. A *topoi* is a category with a notion of sub-object.

"It's a dirty secret that function values need to be computed." Whether functions in programming terminate is related to the topology on the type system.

In an enriched category, we distance ourselves from set theory; instead of having a hom-set, we have a hom-object.

"n-categories are like the complex numbers of category theory."
