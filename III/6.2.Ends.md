# 6.2 Ends & Dinaturality
Once you have stuff defined for the diagonal, off-diagonal elements are somehow constrained.
```
  p : C^op x C -> Set  -- profunctor
  f: a -> b in C

  C^op        diagonal ("y = x")
    |           /
  b -          o (b, b)
  | |         /|
  | |        / |
  | |       /  |             p (id_a, f): (a, a) -> (a, b)
f | |      /   |             p (f, id_b): (b, b) -> (a, b)
  | |     /    |
  | |    /     |
  | |   /      |
  v | (a, a)   v
  a - o -----> o (a, b)
    |/
 ---|-|--------|----- C
   /| a -----> b
  / |     f
```

## Ends
Generalization of a product for profunctors

Product of all diagonal elements of a profunctor

                     o apex
                   / | \
                  /  |  \
                 /   |   \
           pi_a /    |    \ pi_c
               /     |pi_b \
              v      v      v
     Set  ----o------o------o---
      ^    p(a,a) p(b,b) p(c,c)
    p |       ^      ^      ^
      |       |      |      |
  C^op x C ---o------o------o---

Wedges form a category by requiring the expected diagrams to commute.

An *end* is the terminal object in the category of wedges.

On first glance, to include morphisms in the base of a wedge, we would need to have pairs of morphisms going in opposite directions.
 This seems like too strong of a condition to impose on the base category... So instead, we impose that for all `a, b in Ob(C), f: a -> b`
```
  p(id_a, f) o pi_a = p(f, id_b) o pi_b
```

Parametric polymorphism vs. Ad hoc polymorphism

Curry-Howard isomorphism (`and` ~ `x`)

Infinite product ~ `forall a .`

An *end* is an infinite product of diagonal elements, i.e.
```
  type End p = forall a . p a a
```
The only way to produce the infinite number of proofs required to generate an `end` is for `p` to be polymorphic.

## Dinatural transformation
"Natural on the diagonal", i.e. the following diagram commutes
```
  p, q: C^op x C -> Set  -- profunctors
  f: a -> b in C
  d: p => q  -- dinatural transformation

            p b a
          /       \
  p f id /         \ p id f
        /           \
       v             v
     p a a         p b b
       |             |
   d_a |             | d_b
       v             v
     q a a         q b b
        \           /
         \         /
   q f id \       / q id f
           v     v
            q b a
```
Ends can be defined as dinatural transformations of profunctors in much the same way that limits can be defined as natural transformations of functors.
