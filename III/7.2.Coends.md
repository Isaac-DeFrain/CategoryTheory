# 7.2 Coends
Recall: Ninja Yoneda
```
   |\
   |  Set(C(a, x), f x) ~ f a
  \|x
```

In Haskell::
```
  forall x . (a -> x) -> f x ~ f a
```
(hiding `f a`)

An end is a universal wedge.

A *coend* is a universal cowedge. Infinite generalization of a coproduct.
```
  -- Cowedge
                     o apex
                   ^ ^ ^
                  /  |  \
                 /   |   \
            i_a /    |    \ i_c
               /     |i_b  \
              /      |      \
     Set  ---o-------o-------o---
      ^   p(a,a)  p(b,b)  p(c,c)
    p |      ^       ^       ^
      |      |       |       |
  C^op x C --o-------o-------o---
           (a,a)   (b,b)   (c,c)
```
The universal property for a coend is that for every cowedge, there is a unique morphism from the cowedge to the coend.

The cowedge condition is analogous to the wedge condition.
```
  type Coend p = exists x . p x x  -- exists constructor doesn't exist in Haskell
  data Coend p = forall x . Coend p x x
```

In order to deconstruct an existential type, you need a polymorphic function.

A *continuous* functor preserves limits, e.g. it must preserve products.

The hom functor `C(a, -)` is continuous, takes products to products.

The contravariant hom functor `C(-, a)` takes coproducts in `C` to products to in `C`.

To deconstruct a coproduct, you need a product of functions, i.e. in order to deconstruct a coend, you need an end.

Continuity:
```
       |\x             |\
  Set( |  p x x, s) ~  |  Set(p x x, s)
      \|              \|x
```

## Ninja Co-Yoneda
```
   |\x
   |  C(x, a) x f x ~ f a
  \|

  i.e. exists x . ((x -> a), f x) ~ f a
```

*Proof*: Yoneda embedding
```
  a ~ b
  Set(a, s) ~ Set(b, s)

       |\x                     |\
  Set( |  C(x, a) x f x, s) ~  |  Set(C(x, a) x f x, s)
      \|                      \|x

     |\
     |  Set(C(x, a), C(f x, s)) ~ Set(f a, s)  -- contravariant Yoneda lemma
    \|x
```
