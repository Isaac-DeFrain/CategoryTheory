# 4.2 Monad Algebras
Recall: Monad `(T, eta_a: a -> Ta, mu_a: T(Ta) -> Ta)`

List monad algebras have to be monoids.
```
  (a, s: Ta -> a)
  s []  = e  -- monoidal unit
  s [x] = x

  Define product <>:
  x <> y = s [x, y]
  [] <> x  = s [[], x] = s [x] = x
  x  <> [] = s [x, []] = s [x] = x
  (x <> y) <> z = s [x <> y, z] = s [s [x, y], z] = s [s [x, y], s [z]] = s([x, y] ++ z) = s(x ++ y ++ z)
  x <> (y <> z) = s [x, y <> z] = s [x, s [y, z]] = s [s [x], s [y, z]] = s(x ++ [y, z]) = s(x ++ y ++ z)
```

The category of monad algebras for the list monad is equivalent to the category of monoids.

## Adjunctions from monads
Let `T: C -> C` be a monad.

*Eilenberg-Moore category* = `Alg_T` = `C^T`

```
        F^T
      <------       F^T = free T-algebra functor; F^Ta = (Ta, mu_a)
  C^T         C
      ------>       U^T = forgetful functor; U^T(a, _) = a, U^Tm = m
        U^T
```
The algebra coherence conditions follow from the monad laws.

Let's show that this is an adjunction, `F^T -| U^T`.
```
  -- unit
  eta     : Id -> U^T . F^T
  eta(a) = U^T(F^T(a)) = U^T(Ta, mu_a) = Ta
  eta(a) := eta_a

  -- counit
  epsilon : F^T . U^T -> Id
  epsilon((a, s)) = F^T(U^T((a, s))) = F^T(a) = (a, mu_a)
  epsilon((a, s)) = s
```
Then we just need to show that the snake identities hold for this unit and counit.
