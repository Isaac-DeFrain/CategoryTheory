# 3.2 Monad Algebras
Monad laws follow from snake identities and interchange law.

Every adjunction gives rise to a monad and a comonad and every (co)monad gives rise to (many) adjunctions!

Adjunctions can be composed. Given a (co)monad, the adjunctions that generate this (co)monad form a category! This category has an initial and terminal object. The initial object is called the *Eilenberg-Moore* category and the terminal object is called the *Kleisli* category.

The Eilenberg-Moore category is a category of algebras and algebras are sort of dual to monads.

Let `F : C -> C` be an endofunctor. We choose an object `a in Ob(C)` and consider the `F`-algebra `(a, s : F a -> a)`.

`Alg_F` category of `F`-algebras and algebra homomorphisms.

Monad algebra laws (*coherence conditions*):
```
  s . eta = Id        -- compatibility of unit and evaluation
  s . mu = s . (T s)  -- compatibility of multiplication and evaluation
```
## Eilenberg-Moore category
> The Eilenberg-Moore category for a monad `T` is the category of monad algebras for `T`
