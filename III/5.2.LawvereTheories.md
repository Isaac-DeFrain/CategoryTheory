# 5.2 Lawvere Theories
Need to have power relationship between objects in `L_Mon` and a product preserving functor to ensure products in `Set`

what does it mean to have `2 = 1 x 1`? There must be a certain structure on the morphisms i.e. there must be two morphisms `2 -> 1` acting like projections.

The tower of powers is the "skeleton" of the Lawvere theory of any algebra! Then specific algebras are instantiated by adding the appropriate morphisms.

Product preservation is only up to isomorphism.

The dual of the tower of powers is easier to understand. Similar to `FinSet`.

The *skeleton* of a category is one in which all isomorphic objects are collapsed into a single object.

So the opposite category of the tower of powers is the skeleton of `FinSet`.

`FinSet => F (skeleton of FinSet) => F^op (tower of powers) => L_Mon (Lawvere theory of monoids) => Set`

`I_L : F^op -> L_Mon` functor, one-to-one on objects and morphisms

`M : L_Mon -> Set` functor, model

Hom set: `L_Mon(2, 1)` has morphisms like `f x y = mempty / x / y / x <> y / y <> x / x <> x <> y / ...`

`L_Mon(n, 1) ~ Fmon(n)` isomorphic to the free monoid with `n` generators
