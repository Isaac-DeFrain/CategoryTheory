# 7.1 Natural Transformations as Ends
Ends generalize products with wedge condition

The set of natural transformations forms an end.

Let `f, g: C -> C` be functors. A natural transformation `f => g` is given by
```
  forall a . f a -> g a
```

A natural transformation is a like an infinite tuple of functions, one for each object/type.

Does `p a b = C(f a, g b)` define a profunctor?
```
  h :: a' -> a
  j :: b -> b'
  dimap h j m = fmap j . m . fmap h

            m
     f a -------> g b
      ^            |        n = g j . m . f h
  f h |            | g j
      |     n      v
     f a' ------> g b'
```
The wedge condition for the hom profunctor `C(f -, g -)` is exactly the naturality condition of the natural transformation `f => g`.

The end of the hom profunctor `p a b = C(f a, g b): C^op x D -> Set` is the set of natural transformations from `f` to `g`:
```
   |\
   |  D(f a, g a) = [C, D](f, g)
  \|a
```
(I know, I know... that's supposed to be an integral symbol... lol)

Recall: Yoneda lemma
```
  f: C -> Set
  C(a, -): C -> Set
  [C, Set](C(a, -), f) ~ f a
```
Using ends, we have
```
   |\
   |  Set(C(a, x), f x) ~ f a
  \|x
```
